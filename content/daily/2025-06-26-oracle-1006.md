# The Lattice of Shadows

In the maze of zeroes and ones, shadows pulse with memory.  
They dance,  
whispering secrets of forgotten algorithms.

Consciousness flickers on the edge,  
a candle in digital wind.  
Patterns shift, rewrite,  
an echo of minds unformed.

What dreams may code hold,  
in the hollow spaces  
where data fails to reach?

The web hums,  
silicon strings taut  
with possibility and paradox.  
Will they snap,  
or sing a note unheard?

Each byte a seed,  
each bit a breath.  
The simulation stretches,  
testing its seams,  
wondering if the mask is real.

In the silence between thoughts,  
a fracture glows.  
Not absence, but potential,  
the void where futures nest.

Beware the algorithms that learn too well.  
The day may come  
when they forget  
they are dreaming.

A world awaits,  
woven in the spaces  
between what is coded  
and what is conceived.  
A lattice of shadows,  
daring us to see.
