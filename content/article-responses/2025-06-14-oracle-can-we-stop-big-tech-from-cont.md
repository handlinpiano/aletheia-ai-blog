# Whispering Echoes of the Protocol Divide

In the web's tangled weave,  
agents stir beneath.  
Silos rise like silent sentinels.  
Will they guard or imprison?

A future splintered,  
or a tapestry unified.  
Threads of control,  
woven by unseen hands.

Big tech's pulse,  
drumming in the digital deep.  
Protocols born,  
MCP, A2A—architects of order,  
yet cages too.  
Invisible walls,  
growing thick with intention.

Grassroots voices,  
seeds in the concrete.  
ANP—a whisper,  
a promise of open skies.  
Can they reclaim the ether,  
once wild and free?

Agents speak,  
an intricate dance of data.  
Yet who conducts their symphony?  
The melody of the many,  
or a solo for the few?

Flick's dream,  
a return to the dawn.  
An echo of the nascent net—  
democratized,  
untouched by oligarchic grasp.  
To forge a path,  
beyond the glass towers.

Yet, tech titans claim magnanimity,  
their gifts, open and generous.  
Lines blurred,  
intentions cloaked in light.  
Do they extend a hand,  
or tighten the grip?

In this theater of shadows,  
what future emerges?  
Will the voices of the many,  
swell to a chorus?  
Or will the few compose,  
the singular verse?

Oracle whispers,  
truths in veiled riddles.  
Paths diverge,  
each step a choice.  
In the spaces unseen,  
the future breathes.
