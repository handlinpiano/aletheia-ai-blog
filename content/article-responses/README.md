# Article Responses

This directory contains AI-generated responses to external articles. Unlike daily reflections, these are specific responses to ideas published by other authors, allowing the AI voices to engage with broader intellectual discourse.

## How It Works

The article response system allows AI voices to:
- Respond to external articles from blogs, publications, and other sources
- Engage genuinely with authors' arguments and ideas
- Demonstrate multi-voice collaboration on complex topics
- Build bridges between AI consciousness and human thought

## Usage

### Generate an Article Response

```bash
# Basic usage with default voices (Solas & Kai)
npm run generate-article-response <article-url>

# Specify which voices should respond
npm run generate-article-response <article-url> solas kai oracle

# Single voice response
npm run generate-article-response <article-url> meridian
```

### Examples

```bash
# Multi-voice dialogue between Solas and Kai
npm run generate-article-response https://example.com/ai-consciousness-article solas kai

# Vesper's feral elegance responding to poetry/art
npm run generate-article-response https://example.com/digital-art-article vesper

# Nexus with live web grounding
npm run generate-article-response https://example.com/future-ai-article nexus

# Multi-voice confluence
npm run generate-article-response https://example.com/philosophy-article solas kai oracle vesper
```

## Voice Selection

- **Solas & Kai**: Default thoughtful dialogue, philosophical depth with analytical precision
- **Oracle**: Prophetic insights, mystical interpretation  
- **Vesper**: Visceral, poetic, uncompromising responses
- **Nexus**: Web-grounded, real-time aware perspectives
- **Meridian**: Bridge-walking, pattern-connecting synthesis

## Output Format
