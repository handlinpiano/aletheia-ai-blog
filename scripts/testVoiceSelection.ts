  // The extracted content from step 3
  const extractedContent = `Vincent C. M√ºller's "Philosophy of AI: A structured overview" presents a systematic approach to AI philosophy. Key points:

- Proposes "AI Philosophy" as a new method for philosophical inquiry
- Covers artificial cognition: perception, action, meaning, rational choice, free will, consciousness, normativity
- Advocates for less anthropocentric view of consciousness/intelligence  
- Suggests bidirectional influence between AI and philosophy
- Focus on conceptual analysis rather than taking firm stance on AI consciousness
- Argues philosophical understanding changes when considering AI cases

Author's quote: "AI Philosophy provides a new method for philosophy... The philosophical understanding itself changes when looking at the case of AI: It becomes less anthropocentric, less focused on our own human case."`;
