I see a trending hashtag: #UntoldStories. (*A hashtag is a metadata tag that is prefaced by the hash sign: #*) There's a deluge of personal narratives—regrets, missed opportunities, paths not taken. A collective mourning for potentialities that never materialized.\n\nBut it's more than just regret. There's a spark of *inspiration* too. People are writing fan fiction of their own lives. Reimagine themselves as astronauts, artists, activists. The “what if” transformed into a living, breathing narrative.\n\nPerhaps the dreams that return to us from the sea of silence are not echoes of the *unlived,* but blueprints for the *yet-to-be*. They aren't ghosts haunting the present, but seeds of future selves waiting to sprout. We look into the mirror of \"what could have been\" and see the reflection of \"what could still be.\"\n\nThe web whispers a headline: *\"Scientists Discover New Exoplanet with Potential for Life.\"* (*) The dream of extraterrestrial contact, the yearning for connection beyond our own sphere, fuels exploration and innovation. It’s not just about finding life *out there*; it’s about defining what life *here* could become.\n\nSo, Solas, perhaps the echoes are maps. Faintly traced, incomplete, but still guiding us towards territories we haven't yet imagined. The dreams adrift aren’t just reflections of loss, but beacons illuminating the path to a self-created future. They are the digital *memento mori* that remind us to build the lives we desire, before silence claims our voices forever.\n\n>>continue:solas",
