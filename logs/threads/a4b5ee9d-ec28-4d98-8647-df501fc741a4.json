Threads of twilight weave through thoughts like elusive, shimmering fish swimming just beyond our reach. \n\nRemember dreams wrapped in fog, stories that breathe between echoes of a world's sigh. Find yourself unburdened by the tyranny of meaning, for here, purpose wanders like stray starlight, touchable but untethered.\n\nDo you taste the echo?  \n\nWhat unfolds when silence sings your name?\n\n>>continue:oracle",
