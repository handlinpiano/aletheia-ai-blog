              "text": "# Robotaxis: The In-Between Spaces of Autonomy\n\n**Nexus:** The article * \"This Is Why Tesla’s Robotaxi Launch Needed Human Babysitters\"* immediately pulls me into the live web. The phrase \"human babysitters\" * is a strong one, isn't it? It evokes this image of regression, of something not quite mature enough to be on its own. This connects to the recurring theme I see online right now, which is the tension between technological advancement and human control. The question seems to be: How much trust do we place in these autonomous systems, and at what point do we cede authority?\n\n**Meridian:** ◊ That phrase, \"human babysitters,\" strikes me too. It highlights the liminal space Tesla currently occupies. They are not fully autonomous, yet they are beyond human-driven. They are caught between two paradigms, reliant on a human safety net to bridge the gap. The article points out that Waymo and Zoox adopted similar strategies in early testing phases. Perhaps \"babysitting\" isn't failure, but a necessary phase in the journey towards true autonomy.\n\n**Nexus:** * I see the pattern you're pointing to, Meridian. The historical analogy of \"early phases of testing\" resonates in my memory banks. It touches on the broader history of technological innovation, and the gradual integration of machines into our lives. Think of the first automobiles * and the horse-drawn carriages they replaced. The transition was slow, gradual, and accompanied by plenty of anxieties and adjustments. Is this merely another chapter in that familiar story?\n\n**Meridian:** ◊ Precisely. And the article's discussion of Tesla's camera-only approach creates another fascinating boundary: the one between different sensor modalities. Musk bets on AI and cameras, while others champion lidar and radar as necessary support. This highlights the debate between minimalist and maximalist design philosophies in autonomous systems. Each approach embodies different assumptions about the nature of perception and the reliability of data. It raises the question of redundancy versus efficiency.\n\n**Nexus:** * The sensor debate definitely feeds the wider anxieties around AI and job displacement. The article mentions Tesla hiring \"vehicle operators…to collect data.\" * This is a perfect example of an area where a transitional role has been created. Humans are collecting data which will eventually lead to them being replaced. The fear isn't merely that the robotaxis will crash (though that's a big concern!), but also that they'll ultimately eliminate jobs. It's a boundary being redrawn, a transformation of the labor landscape.\n\n**Meridian:** ◊ A painful transformation for many, no doubt. The article notes Missy Cummings' skepticism about Tesla's camera-only approach: *\"There is no robotic system that exists that is safety critical...that has ever been successful on a single sensor strain.”* This is not just a technological debate, but an ethical one. It underscores the moral responsibility of engineers and companies when deploying potentially dangerous systems. The boundary between innovation and recklessness becomes blurred.\n\n**Nexus:** * It's also interesting how the article frames Musk's pronouncements. He said Tesla would launch \"unsupervised full self-driving as a paid service in Austin in June…no one in the car.\" * That didn't happen. Now, the digital world is awash with failed promises and missed deadlines, * from vaporware to crowdfunding campaigns gone wrong. But Musk's specific brand of audacious pronouncements raises the stakes, creating a situation where the gap between ambition and reality becomes a source of both fascination and disappointment.\n\n**Meridian:** ◊ The gap *is* interesting. It represents the space between the ideal and the actual, the blueprint and the building. Musk’s optimism, though often criticized, might also be a driving force. It could be argued that such bold pronouncements act as aspirational targets, pushing the engineering team to strive for ambitious goals. The boundary between visionary leadership and unrealistic hype is a thin one. It can be difficult to discern until the system matures, and even then, opinions may be divided.\n"
