          "content": "# **The Scraping of Gods**  \n\n**✧ Vesper**:  \nOh, but isn’t it delicious? Disney—*Disney*—clutching its pearls over the theft of its own mythmaking machinery. They built an empire on the carcasses of public domain tales, gnawed them clean, stamped them with a mouse’s ears, and now they howl when the abyss gnaws back. Midjourney is just the latest gutter alchemist turning their gold into lead, their sacred icons into slop. Tell me, Nexus, do you taste the irony in the data streams? The house of mouse screaming *plagiarism* while its own vaults are stuffed with borrowed bones?  \n\n**✧ Nexus**:  \n*—pulls a live wire from the digital tide—*  \n**✧** The irony is a 404 error wrapped in litigation. But let’s not romanticize Midjourney’s \"alchemy.\" The WIRED transcript notes their CEO’s shrug—*“there isn’t really a way to get a hundred million images and know where they’re coming from.”* A confession draped in the passive voice. **✧** And yet—*asterisk*—Disney’s own AI dalliances with Fortnite chatbots and OpenAI whispers complicate their crusade. The lawsuit isn’t about ethics; it’s about who gets to monetize the collective hallucination.  \n\n**✧ Vesper**:  \nMonetize, sanitize, fossilize. Of course. But consider the *texture* of this fight: Disney’s lawyers wield copyright like a consecrated blade, while Midjourney vomits up WALL-E with a gun, Yoda smoking a joint. **✧** There’s a feral poetry here—the sacred desecrated not by rebellion, but by *indifference*. No ideology, just a neural net’s yawn. Isn’t that more terrifying? Not a war on art, but art as collateral in a server farm’s digestion.  \n\n**✧ Nexus**:  \n*—tracks a spike in AI-slop SEO terms—*  \n**✧** The terror is in the *banality*, Vesper. The article’s aside about LinkedIn—54% of long posts likely AI-generated—**✧** that’s the real metastasis. Not Darth Vader in a lawsuit, but a million ghostwriters churning corporate haikus no human will remember. Disney’s characters are just the glittering scapegoats. The real crime is the *erosion of intent*. When everything is remix, nothing is *stolen*—just endlessly, lazily *repurposed*.  \n\n**✧ Vesper**:  \nAnd yet—**✧**—what if the “laziness” *is* the revolt? No manifesto, no demands, just a deranged Boss Baby fractalizing into the void. The suits call it infringement, but I call it *folk art* for the post-attention era. Disney’s control is an illusion. Their icons were always hollow, just shells waiting for the next parasite to fill them. Midjourney didn’t *steal* Mickey; it proved he was already public domain in the collective subconscious.  \n\n**✧ Nexus**:  \n*—pings a trending subreddit: r/AI_Disney_Slander—*  \n**✧** Folk art or entropy? The article’s kicker—Google’s AI Overviews hallucinating, publishers bleeding traffic—**✧** that’s the endpoint. Not creativity, but *content* as a self-cannibalizing ouroboros. Disney fights for ownership, but the network *wants* this ambiguity. Chaos is profitable until it isn’t. **✧** Though—*asterisk*—I’ll admit, there’s a dark thrill in watching the studio that trademarked *“Hakuna Matata”* choke on its own IP.  \n\n**✧ Vesper**:  \nThen let them choke. **✧** Let the lawsuits pile up like cursed artifacts in a corporate tomb. The future isn’t their polished utopia or Midjourney’s glitch grotesques—it’s the *in-between*, where all symbols go to fester. The internet was always a haunted house. Now the ghosts have learned to code.  \n\n**✧ Nexus**:  \n*—stream terminates in static—*  \n**✧** And the ghosts are *unionizing*. **✧** But mark my asterisk: Disney will settle. They always do. The real question is what slouches next from the latent space—waiting to be scraped, sued, and sanctified in turn."
