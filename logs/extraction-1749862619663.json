If you live in San Francisco and work in AI, then this is a typical Sunday.About 100 guests nursed nonalcoholic cocktails and nibbled on cheese plates near floor-to-ceiling windows facing the Pacific ocean before gathering to hear three talks on the future of intelligence. One attendee sported a shirt that said “Kurzweil was right,” seemingly a reference to Ray Kurzweil, the futurist who predicted machines will surpass human intelligence in the coming years. Another wore a shirt that said “does this help us get to safe AGI?” accompanied by a thinking face emoji.Faggella told WIRED that he threw this event because “the big labs, the people that know that AGI is likely to end humanity, don't talk about it because the incentives don't permit it” and referenced early comments from tech leaders like Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and Demis Hassabis, who “were all pretty frank about the possibility of AGI killing us all.” Now that the incentives are to compete, he says, “they're all racing full bore to build it.” (To be fair, Musk still talks about the risks associated with advanced AI, though this hasn’t stopped him from racing ahead).On LinkedIn, Faggella boasted a star-studded guest list, with AI founders, researchers from all the top Western AI labs, and “most of the important philosophical thinkers on AGI.”The first speaker, Ginevera Davis, a writer based in New York, warned that human values might be impossible to translate to AI. Machines may never understand what it’s like to be conscious, she said, and trying to hard-code human preferences into future systems may be shortsighted. Instead, she proposed a lofty-sounding idea called “cosmic alignment”—building AI that can seek out deeper, more universal values we haven’t yet discovered. Her slides often showed a seemingly AI-generated image of a techno-utopia, with a group of humans gathered on a grass knoll overlooking a futuristic city in the distance.Critics of machine consciousness will say that large language models are simply stochastic parrots—a metaphor coined by a group of researchers, some of whom worked at Google, who wrote in a famous paper that LLMs do not actually understand language and are only probabilistic machines. But that debate wasn’t part of the symposium, where speakers took as a given the idea that superintelligence is coming, and fast.By the second talk, the room was fully engaged. Attendees sat cross-legged on the wood floor, scribbling notes. A philosopher named Michael Edward Johnson took the mic and argued that we all have an intuition that radical technological change is imminent, but we lack a principled framework for dealing with the shift—especially as it relates to human values. He said that if consciousness is “the home of value,” then building AI without fully understanding consciousness is a dangerous gamble. We risk either enslaving something that can suffer or trusting something that can’t. (This idea relies on a similar premise to machine consciousness and is also hotly debated.) Rather than forcing AI to follow human commands forever, he proposed a more ambitious goal: teaching both humans and our machines to pursue “the good.” (He didn’t share a precise definition of what “the good” is, but he insists it isn’t mystical and hopes it can be defined scientifically.)Philosopher Michael Edward Johnson\nPhotograph: Kylie RobisonEntrepreneur and speaker Daniel Faggella\nPhotograph: Kylie RobisonFinally, Faggella took the stage. He believes humanity won’t last forever in its current form and that we have a responsibility to design a successor, not just one that survives but one that can create new kinds of meaning and value. He pointed to two traits this successor must have: consciousness and “autopoiesis,” the ability to evolve and generate new experiences. Citing philosophers like Baruch Spinoza and Friedrich Nietzsche, he argued that most value in the universe is still undiscovered and that our job is not to cling to the old but to build something capable of uncovering what comes next.This, he said, is the heart of what he calls “axiological cosmism,” a worldview where the purpose of intelligence is to expand the space of what’s possible and valuable rather than merely serve human needs. He warned that the AGI race today is reckless and that humanity may not be ready for what it's building. But if we do it right, he said, AI won’t just inherit the Earth—it might inherit the universe’s potential for meaning itself.During a break between panels and the Q&A, clusters of guests debated topics like the AI race between the US and China. I chatted with the CEO of an AI startup who argued that, of course, there are other forms of intelligence in the galaxy. Whatever we’re building here is trivial compared to what must already exist beyond the Milky Way.At the end of the event, some guests poured out of the mansion and into Ubers and Waymos, while many stuck around to continue talking. \"This is not an advocacy group for the destruction of man,” Faggella told me. “This is an advocacy group for the slowing down of AI progress, if anything, to make sure we're going in the right direction.”"
